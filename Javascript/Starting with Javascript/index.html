</head>
<body>
    <div class="Js-conditional-statements">
        <p>In javascript there are pieces of code called conditionals and developers can use them to run the code conditionally.</p>

<h1>If-Statement</h1>
<p>The if statement checks a condition and will execute a code if the condition is met or True.
</p>


<h1>If-Else statement</h1>
<p>This statement handles both outcomes of our conditional request using the else keyword,If condition is true, do something,if its false do something else.
An if statement can be used to run code based on a condition being True.
</p>



<h2>You need to execute the code based on a certain condition being either True or False.which of the following types of statements can you use to complete the task.A conditionn statement</h2>
<h3>In computer programming,there may arise situations where you have to run a block of code among more than one alternatives.</h3>
<div.syntax-1>
    [Syntax]
    if(Condition)
    {
    
    // Block of code if condition is True;
    
    
    }
    else
    {
    
        //Block of code if condition is False;
    }
</div.syntax>


<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<p>In javscript we have the following conditional statements:-
    <ol>
        <li>Use If to specify a block of code to be executed , if a specified condition is True.</li>
 
        <li>Use Else to specify a block of code to be executed,if the first condition if False.</li>

        <li>If-Else is better suited if there is a binary choice in the condition.</li>

        <li>If you need to make sure that multiple conditons are True in an if statement,You can do using the && Operator.</li>

        <li>In javascript , the correct syntax of the greater than or equal to Operator is >= </li>

    </ol>

</p>

<h1>Switch-Statement</h1>
<p>In javascript switch statement is used for decision making.The switch statement evaluates an expression and executes the corrresponding body that matches the expressions result.
<div class="syntax-2">
[Syntax]
switch(Variable/Expression)
{
    case value 1 :
    //Body of case 1
    break;

    case value 2 :
    //Body of case 2
    break;

    case value 3 :
    //Body of value 3
    break;

    case value so on :
    //Body of case value So on 
    break;

    default :
    //Body of default 
    
    }
</div>
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on diferrent conditions.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use switch to specify many alternative block of code to be executed.</li>

    <li>The switch expression is evaluated once.</li>

    <li>The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.</li>

<li>If there is a match , the associated block of code is executed.</li>

<li>If there is no match, the default code block is executed.</li>

</ol>
</p>
<h3>The break keyword:-</h3>
<p>When javascript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.this will stop the execution inside the switch block.it is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block.the block ends there anyway.
dont forget to add a break at the very end of each case in a switch statement
</p>


<h3>The default keyword:-</h3>
<p>The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match.

if default is not the lastcase in the switch block,REMEMBER to end the default case with a break.
</p>
<p>The break statement is optional.if the break statement is encountered,the switch statement ends.
    if the the break statement is not used,the casesafter the matching case are also executed.
the default clause is also an optional.
**Multiple cases in switch statements:-In a javascript switch statement,cases can be grouped to share the same code.
</p>
</div>

<div class="Javscript-loops">
    <p>Loop that means a structure , a series , or process the end of which is connected to the beginning.</p>
<h1>What are loops in javascript?</h1>
<p>In programming language , loops are used to repeat a block of code under certain condition.For example if you want to show a message 100 times,then you can use a loop.</p>

<p>Javascript developers use loops to continually execute and repeated blocks of code until a caetain condition is satisfied.</p>
<ul.important-notes>
    <li>Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.</li>
    <li>Loops are handly,if you want to run a code the same over and over again , each time with a diferrent value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Different Kinds of loops:-</h2>
<p>Javascript supports different kinds of loops.
    <ol>
        <li>for:- Loops through a block of code a number of times.</li>
<li>for/In:-Loops through the properties of an object.</li>
<li>for/of:-Loops through the values of an iterable object.</li>
<li>Whileloop:-Loops through a block of code while a specified condition is True.</li>
<li>doWhileloop:- Also loops through a block of code  while a specified condition is True.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<div class="forLoop">
<h1>The for-Loop</h1>
<p>for is a declaration keyword,and the counter is a variable which is typically named i for iterator.The for statements creates a loop with 3 optional terms or expressions.</p>
<p>For loops are essentially trying to iterate to run a piece of code many many times.</p>
<div class="forloopSyntax">
    for(Intialexpression(Intialization) ; Condition ; update expression(Iteration))
    {


        //forLoop body code to be executed;
    }

</div>
<ol>

    <li>Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
        Ofcourse you can intiate many values in expression 1(Seperated by comma)
    </li>
<li>Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block
    often expression 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the intial variable.
If expression 2 returns True,the loop will start over again, and if returns false,the loop will end
</li>

<li>Expression 3 which is an updateexpression (everytime) after the code block has been executed.
An expression 3 can do anything like Negative increment-- OR positive increment(i++) or anything else.
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Loopscope</h2>
<p><ol>
    <li>Using var in a loop:- 
        Using var,the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable outside the loop.
    </li>

    <li>Using let in a loop:-
Using let,the variable declared in the loop cannot be redeclare the variable outside the loop.
when let is declared the variable.
    </li>




</ol></p>
</div>

<div class="whileLoop">
    <h1>Javascript while-Loop</h1>
    <p>Code that repeats as long as specified condition is TRUE.
    </p>
    <p>A while-loop will keep looping through a code block as long as specified condition is True.</p>
<p>Loops are common way to automate code repetition</p>
<div class="while-LoopSyntax">
    <h2>The syntax of the while-Loop is</h2>
     
    Variable declaration

    while(Condition)
    {
     //Body of Loop

     //Increment or decrement


    }
</div>
<h3>Whats the difference between for Vs while-Loop?</h3>
<p>A for-Loop is usually used when the number of iterations is known.& 
   A while-Loop and do-whileLoop are usually used when the number of iterations are unknown.
</p>








</div>

<div class="do-Whileloop">
    <p>Do-while loop is similar to the whileloop the only differnce is that in do-while loop,the body of loop is executed at least once.
        Do-while loop first executes the body then test the condition either True or False.
    </p>
    <div class="doWhileloopSyntax">
        do{

//Body of loop

        }
        while(condition)

    </div>










</div>

<div class="Nestedloop">
<p>Outerloop and Innerloop
    You are running multiple nested loops within your javascript code.could these nested loops cause performance issues with your code.True,the more nested loops tehre are the slower your code will run.


</p>
